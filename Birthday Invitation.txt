Subject: You're Invited! My Birthday Bash!

Hey Akash,

I'm so excited to invite you to celebrate my birthday with me! I'm turning 20 on February 28 and I'd love for you to be there.

I'm planning a get-together and dinner at my home on February 28 from evening to night.

It would mean a lot to me if you could make it. Please let me know if you'll be able to come by February 27 so I can get a headcount.

Looking forward to celebrating with you!

Best,

Aditya
